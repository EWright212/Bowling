## Bowling Kata

This bowling kata was completed as part of the weekend challenge for Makers Academy week 6.

#### Requirements

I implemented the [ten-pin bowling score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring) calculator based on input of a string representing a player's ten frames. It looks something like this: 'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'; where each frame is space-delimited, 'X' represents strikes, and '/' represents spares.

My challenge was to take this string of frames and return the players total score.

I based my input on this [codewars kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/ten-pin-bowling).

#### Tech Stack

I used JavaScript and the Jasmine testing framework for this challenge.

#### How to Run

Fork and clone this repository.

#### How to Test

Open 'SpecRunner.html' in your browser to run the Jasmine tests.

#### Reflections

This was one of my first projects in JavaScript. 

- I enjoyed learning JavaScript and Jasmine syntax. I found it simple to set up and enjoyed learning it.

- I used the constructor prototype method in my functions which is easy to use and understand.

- I followed the TDD process well, creating many tests and creating the project step by step. This is evidenced by my 30 tests and many commits for this challenge.

- I had completed this kata before in Ruby and could see the improvements in my process of TDDing the next simple step. 

- I could also see improvements in my skills as I created methods more in line with the Single Responsibility Principle.

#### Ideas for next time

- Ultimately my code is fairly lengthy and verbose, so the next time I complete this kata I would like to focus on refactoring. 

- Other Katas take in input of one roll at once, so I would like to see the changes that would cause, compared to my method of inputting all scores at once.

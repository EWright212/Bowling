## Bowling Kata

This bowling kata was completed as part of the weekend challenge for Makers Academy week 6.

#### How to Run

Fork and clone this repository.



#### Reflections

This was one of my first projects in JavaScript. 

- I enjoyed learning JavaScript and Jasmine syntax. I found it simple to set up and enjoyed learning it.

- I used the constructor prototype method in my functions which is easy to use and understand.

- I followed the TDD process well, creating many tests and creating the project step by step. This is evidenced by my 30 tests and many commits for this challenge.

- I had completed this kata before in Ruby and could see the improvements in my process of TDDing the next simple step. 

- I could also see improvements in my skills as I created methods more in line with the Single Responsibility Principle.

##### Ideas for next time

- Ultimately my code is fairly lengthy and verbose, so the next time I complete this kata I would like to focus on refactoring. 

- Other Katas take in input of one roll at once, so I would like to see the changes that would cause, compared to my method of inputting all scores at once.
